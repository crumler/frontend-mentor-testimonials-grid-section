## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my solution to this front-end coding challenge!

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible.

The goal was for users to be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## Where I found everything

My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. Within that folder, you will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

I was provided all of the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets were already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file that contained the information I needed to complete this project, such as color palette and fonts.
